Substance Source is the largest library of PBR materials, and it continues to grow with regular additions of new assets, parameters and options.

Download Substances and use them directly or use the parameters and make them your own!

How to use:
1. Once the package is loaded into Unity, go to the Substance Menu at the top of the Unity UI and choose Source. 
2. Login to Source, browse and download a Substance. The Substance will be added to the Asset Browser in a Material Folder.
